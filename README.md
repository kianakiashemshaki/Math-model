## ðŸ›  Methods and Tools
### Data Analysis:
- **EDA:** Investigated distributions and patterns across countries, topics, and question levels.
- **Statistical Testing:** Used chi-squared tests to assess significant differences.

### Machine Learning:
- **Algorithms Used:** 
  - Logistic Regression
  - Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Applied GridSearchCV on the Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes model.

### Visualization:
